# Full-AUTOSAR-Layered-Architecture-Project-
This project implements AUTOSAR-compliant Port, DIO, and GPT drivers based on version 4.0.2 of the standard. A simple application demonstrates their usage for task activation based on time intervals, running on a lightweight operating system. 
Full Layered Architecture Model Based on DIO and PORT AUTOSAR Drivers to initialize and control the GPIOs of TM4C ARM-based Microcontrollers. A simple operating system with a time-triggered based scheduler is implemented to control the tasks. Designed Drivers for the project: AUTOSAR DIO, AUTOSAR PORT
